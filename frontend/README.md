### About The Build:

**Trendle** is a simple social platform where users can post, like, comment, follow other users, and send private messages. We used **a bit of Firebase** to help with some functionalities (you’ll see how it fits in 😉). This project has a cool interface and works on both large and small screens, all the way down to 375px.

## How We Built It:

### **Vite + React.js + Tailwind CSS**

We used **Vite** as our build tool to make things faster and smoother while building the site. We styled everything with **Tailwind CSS**, so the pages look neat and responsive.
